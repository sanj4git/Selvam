# Project Vision

## Unified Family Finance & Wealth Management Platform

---

## 1. Vision Statement

The vision of this project is to build a unified, intelligent financial management platform that enables Indian households to track expenses, monitor investments, manage liabilities, and gain actionable financial insights from a single dashboard.

The platform aims to provide a complete picture of a family’s financial health by consolidating cash flow, assets, liabilities, and future obligations into one system.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most existing financial applications focus on isolated aspects of money management, such as expense tracking or investment monitoring, but fail to provide a holistic view of household finances.

Common limitations include:

- Expense trackers that do not include investments or liabilities
- Investment platforms that ignore daily expenses and bills
- Fragmented tools requiring multiple applications
- Lack of India-centric financial instruments
- Minimal guidance or actionable insights

As a result, families lack clarity on their true net worth, spending patterns, and long-term financial sustainability.

## 3. Proposed Solution

This project proposes a MERN-based web platform that acts as a single source of truth for household finances.

The system aggregates expenses, assets, investments, liabilities, and recurring obligations into a centralized dashboard, supported by data visualization, alerts, and AI-driven insights.

The long-term goal is to evolve the platform into a full-fledged personal and family finance companion and later extend it into a mobile application.
